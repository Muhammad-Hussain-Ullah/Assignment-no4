          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Plan Your Meals Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            Meal planning is key to eating healthy on a college budget. When you
            plan your meals in advance, you're less likely to grab unhealthy
            snacks or fast food. Here's how to get started:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <em>Make a weekly menu</em>: Plan out simple breakfasts, lunches,
              and dinners for the week.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Batch cooking</em>: Prepare meals in bulk, such as rice,
              chicken, and vegetables, so you can quickly heat them up during
              busy days.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Grocery list</em>: Make a list based on your menu to avoid
              impulse buys that don’t fit into your healthy plan.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Focus on affordable staples like whole grains,
            beans, eggs, and frozen vegetables to stretch your budget while
            staying healthy.
          </p>{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Incorporate Balanced Meals</h2>
          <p>
            Balancing your meals with the right macronutrients — proteins, fats,
            and carbohydrates — will help you stay full longer and maintain your
            energy levels throughout the day.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <em>Proteins</em>: Chicken, eggs, tofu, beans, and fish provide
              essential protein for muscle repair and energy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Healthy fats</em>: Avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil offer
              healthy fats that support brain function and overall health.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Whole grains</em>: Opt for brown rice, whole wheat bread, and
              oats instead of refined grains for better digestion and sustained
              energy.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Example Meal:</strong> Grilled chicken with quinoa (or brown
            rice), steamed broccoli, and a drizzle of olive oil. This meal is
            packed with protein, fiber, and healthy fats to keep you energized.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Healthy Snacks for On-the-Go</h2>
          <p>
            College life often involves hectic schedules, but having healthy
            snacks on hand can prevent you from reaching for chips or candy
            between classes. Here are some quick and nutritious options:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <em>Greek yogurt with fruit</em>: High in protein and probiotics
              for gut health.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Mixed nuts</em>: Packed with healthy fats, protein, and fiber.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Hummus with carrots or celery</em>: A crunchy, savory snack
              that’s rich in fiber and plant-based protein.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Fresh fruit</em>: Apples, bananas, and oranges are easy to
              grab and packed with vitamins.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Pack snacks in your bag the night before to
            avoid vending machine temptations during long days.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Stay Hydrated</h2>
          <p>
            It’s easy to forget about hydration when you’re focused on classes
            and studying, but drinking enough water is essential for your body
            to function properly. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches,
            and a lack of concentration.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <em>Carry a water bottle</em>: Make it a habit to bring a reusable
              water bottle to class and refill it throughout the day.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Avoid sugary drinks</em>: Energy drinks and sodas may seem
              like quick pick-me-ups, but they lead to crashes later on. Opt for
              water, herbal teas, or naturally flavored water instead.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Aim for at least 8 glasses (or 2 liters) of
            water daily, and more if you’re active.
          </p>

            Make Smart Choices in the Dining Hall
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you’re relying on the college dining hall for most of your meals,
            it can still be possible to eat healthily with a few mindful
            choices:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <em>Choose lean proteins</em>: Look for grilled chicken, fish, or
              tofu, and avoid fried options.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Fill half your plate with vegetables</em>: Load up on salads
              or steamed veggies to ensure you’re getting enough nutrients.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Be mindful of portion sizes</em>: It’s easy to overeat in a
              buffet-style setting, so start with smaller portions and go back
              for seconds only if you're still hungry.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Try to avoid the pizza and burger section more
            often and gravitate toward fresh salads, soups, and whole grain
            options.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Avoid Late-Night Snacking</h2>
          <p>
            Late-night study sessions often lead to unnecessary snacking,
            especially on unhealthy foods like chips or candy. If you feel the
            urge to snack late at night, try to make healthier choices:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <em>Fruit and nuts</em>: Opt for an apple with almond butter or a
              handful of almonds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Greek yogurt</em>: Add a spoonful of honey or some berries for
              a satisfying, low-sugar treat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Air-popped popcorn</em>: A healthy alternative to chips, low
              in calories and high in fiber.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Set a cutoff time for eating, such as 9 or 10
            p.m., to avoid mindless snacking before bed.
          </p>
        </li>

            grocery list:

            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

          </ul>
          <p>

          <p>
            Finally, the most important part of maintaining a healthy diet in
            college is learning to listen to your body. Pay attention to hunger
            cues, eat mindfully, and avoid emotional eating. Strive for balance

            it’s part of an overall healthy lifestyle.

        </li>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Conclusion</h2>
